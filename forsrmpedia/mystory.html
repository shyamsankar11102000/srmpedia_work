<p>I was born on the 11th of october in the year 2000 in a place that i would proudly call as the "GOD'S OWN COUNTRY-KERALA".
My immediate family consists of my mother, my father and my sister. I spent the early part of my childhood in my father's 
native place and experienced all the fun one could have when you live in a joint family. I left my kindergarten halfway
and moved to palakkad where i spent most of my life later. i joined straight to 1st std and then on it was a school life
filled with fun. My school was just a 5 minutes walk from my house and as everyone. My school life like many of us you who
are reading this were full of infactuations, one sided love and blah blah.............<br>
I finished my schooling in the year 2018. I joined SRM Institute Of Science And Technology for btech in Computer Science.
